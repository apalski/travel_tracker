## Introduction
The Travel Tracker Sinatra Application allows a user to keep track of countries and cities they have visited around the world. The app ensures that duplication of cities and countries cannot occur. The results are displayed alphabetically for both countries and cities. The city listing additionally contains the country the city is in and displays first with the country and then with the cities that country contains that have been visited. Again, all this is done alphabetically.

## Installation & Usage
To use this app, just clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything is set up and ready for you to use.

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. You can run `tux` or `rake console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
